## Who am I?
<div style="text-align: left"> I'm Austin, a former Civil Engineering student who has transitioned into Web Development, where my love for building projects and learning new technologies has flourished. I learned to code at the Turing School of Software Design, where I specialized in back-end development. My hobbies include fitness, gaming, and talking about my two cats. I do my best work when working with others and I would love to connect with other coders who love to collaborate. My email is below, but feel free to explore the rest of my portfolio while you're here! </div>
